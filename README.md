Unfortunately, I am at times a lousy correspondent — where by “at times” I mean “most of the time”. If I don’t respond to your email, or do so only after an inordinate amount of time has passed you can find me in the water dodging surfers in the crowded pacific ocean trying to catch a couple of waves or on twitter [@AlsuTurki](https://twitter.com/AlsuTurki).
